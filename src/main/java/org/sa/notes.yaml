TASKS:
  - make enlist card pool in cards pool
  - create Enlist card and place in playerDTO constructor:
      - enlistCard interface + concreted classes implementing just like Missions
  - enter playerDTO details
  - generate random attack card when dealing (not pull from the pool)
  - display board visually
  - make CardPool:
    - should contain all types of cards Faction:
        - enlistCards
        - missionCards

LATER:
  - enter each faction details
  - goodieCards can come later in the CardPool (after first working version)

LETS_NOT:
  - have attack cards in the pool, since easier to simply generate random one
