TASKS:
  - mark homes in factions as well as in grid!!!
  - test:
    - if grid index matches DTO index!!!,
    - no tiles match for in exact grid coordinates,
    - has at least 2 neighbours
  - mark rivers in Board.gird for each TileDTO
  - fix grid (new coordinates, include home tiles):
    - include TileType.HOME in the Board.grid
  - create Enlist card and place in playerDTO constructor:
      - enlistCard interface + concreted classes implementing just like Missions
  - add one more mission
  - enter playerDTO details
  - generate random attack card when dealing (not pull from the pool)
  - make CardPool:
    - should contain all types of cards Faction:
        - enlistCards
        - missionCards

LATER:
  - enter each faction details
  - goodieCards can come later in the CardPool (after first working version)

LETS_NOT:
  - have attack cards in the pool, since easier to simply generate random one
