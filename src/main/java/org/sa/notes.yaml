TASKS:
  - deal enlistCard in the PlayerDTO constructor
  - initial turn:
    - everything else is initialised in PlayerDTO constructor (automatically, no decisions)
      - initialise straight from faction details to player state
      - player should have enlist state
        - initialise it using enlist card (enum)

LATER:
  - player should pick initial tile for worker but for now we take the first one in the set
  - create turn type (enum) move / enlist / produce
  - display board visually
  - finish all the CardPool, so all the cards are entered
  - goodieCards can come later in the CardPool (after first working version) (the ones that are spread all over the grid)
  - player chooses where to place workers in PlayerDecisions

LETS_NOT:
  - change Faction details using Reward // maybe not because they are constant and doesn't require picking (decision)
